        <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>The <i>cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental edible plants.</p>

        <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history can be traced back for centuries, although they were re-invented in the 1870s <u>England</u>, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and vigorously maintained English estate gardens.</p>

        <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with some fruit trees.</p>
